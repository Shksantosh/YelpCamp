# YelpCamp
YelpCamp is a web Application in which users can find campgrounds and review them. Users can also add their own campgrounds. A map has also been displayed for better searching. When a user enters a location, the map finds and shows it automatically. I have completely revamped the UI and made it into a dark mode for reducing eye strain. It is already populated with Indian cities. Implemented a fuzzy search with autocmplete feature using MongoDB Atlas search.
